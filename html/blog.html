            <h2>Why Garfield is Better than Nermal</h2>
            <p>Garfield, the beloved feline character created by Jim Davis, holds a special place in the hearts of millions worldwide, and for good reason. Garfield's charm lies in his relatable personality traits and humorous antics. With his insatiable love for lasagna, disdain for Mondays, and unabashed laziness, Garfield embodies the essence of a typical, albeit exaggerated, housecat. In contrast, Nermal, another cat in the Garfield comics, lacks the depth and complexity that make Garfield so endearing. Nermal's primary traits revolve around his perceived cuteness and attempts to outshine Garfield, but these qualities pale in comparison to Garfield's wit and charisma. Ultimately, Garfield's enduring popularity and cultural impact solidify his status as a superior character, winning the hearts of fans across generations.            </p>
